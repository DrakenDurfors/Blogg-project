# Blogg-project

This repository consists of the code used for a blogg.

It utilises Html and CSS for the front-end and uses PHP and MySql for the back-end. Sadly none of the Sql code has been saved to this repository so it is not opperational as it stands.

The Sql code may be recreated at a later time, but seeing as this is an old and finished project it is unlikely.

If the sql code would have been added this code should be able to create, delete, update and delete articles on the blogg. It also includes a very primitive search function as well as a category system.
